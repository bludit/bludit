Lingonberry is a clean and simple theme for bloggers, with responsive design and beautiful typography.
Lingonberry’s got all the features you need, and none that you don’t. It’s designed to be easy to install, use and visit.
As the name implies, Lingonberry has a charming, simple and colorful visual style that is easy on the eyes (and on the loading times).
Responsive design and high-resolution assets means that Lingonberry will scale gracefully and look great on all devices – big and small, retina and non-retina.
